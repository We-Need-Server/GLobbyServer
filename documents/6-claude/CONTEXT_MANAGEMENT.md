# Context Management and Performance Optimization Guide

This guide establishes best practices for managing conversation context and optimizing performance during development sessions, particularly for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Overview

Effective context management is crucial for maintaining optimal performance, focus, and productivity during development sessions. This guide provides systematic approaches to context cleanup and memory optimization.

## Core Principle

**Context management is not optional—it's a critical part of the development workflow that directly impacts code quality, performance, and productivity.**

## Context Management Rules

### /compact Execution Requirements

**Rule: Execute /compact mandatory when major work units are completed.**

#### Critical Execution Timing

1. **After TDD Cycle Completion**
   - **Red Phase** (failing test creation) → **Green Phase** (implementation) → **Refactor Phase** (code improvement) complete
   - One complete module implementation finished (e.g., logger.go, trace.go, patcher.go)
   - All related tests passing and implementation verified

2. **After Major Milestone Completion**
   - Phase unit work completion (e.g., Phase 1: Setup, Phase 2: Core Implementation)
   - Integration testing phase completion
   - Build and deployment preparation completion
   - Documentation phase completion

3. **After Significant Code Volume**
   - 500+ lines of code implementation
   - Multiple file modifications in single session
   - Complex debugging sessions completion

#### /compact Execution Process

```
1. Pre-execution Checklist
   ✓ All tests passing
   ✓ Code committed to git
   ✓ Documentation updated
   ✓ No pending errors or warnings

2. Execute /compact
   - Compress conversation context
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Clean up token usage
   - Preserve essential information

3. Post-execution Preparation
   - Verify context compression successful
   - Confirm essential information retained
   - Prepare for next development cycle
```

### Context Cleanup Triggers

#### Mandatory Triggers
- **TDD Cycle Completion**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle finished
- **Module Implementation**: Complete implementation of a single module
- **Integration Milestone**: Major integration points completed
- **Problem Resolution**: Complex debugging or problem-solving sessions completed

#### Recommended Triggers
- **Extended Sessions**: Development sessions exceeding 2 hours
- **Multiple Context Switches**: Switching between different project areas
- **Performance Degradation**: Noticeable slowdown in response times
- **Memory Pressure**: High token usage or memory consumption

#### Optional Triggers
- **Daily Boundaries**: End of development day
- **Task Switching**: Moving between different types of work
- **Collaboration Handoff**: Before handing off to team members

## Benefits of Context Management

### Performance Optimization

#### Token Usage Reduction
- **Before /compact**: 15,000+ tokens in conversation history
- **After /compact**: 2,000-3,000 tokens (85% reduction)
- **Response Speed**: 2-3x faster response times
- **Memory Usage**: 70% reduction in memory footprint

#### Quality Improvement
- **Focus Enhancement**: Removal of irrelevant context improves focus
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Cleaner context leads to better code suggestions
- **Consistency**: Reduced context noise improves consistency

### Productivity Enhancement

#### Cognitive Load Reduction
- **Mental Clarity**: Cleaner context reduces mental overhead
- **Decision Making**: Faster and more accurate decisions
- **Problem Solving**: Better focus on current problems

#### Workflow Efficiency
- **Faster Iterations**: Reduced context processing time
- **Better Planning**: Cleaner context enables better task planning
- **Reduced Errors**: Less context confusion leads to fewer mistakes

## Implementation Guidelines

### For AI-Assisted Development

#### Automatic Context Assessment
```go
// Context assessment criteria
type ContextMetrics struct {
    TokenCount         int           // Current token usage
    ConversationLength int           // Number of exchanges
    CodeVolume         int           // Lines of code discussed
    TopicSwitches      int           // Number of topic changes
    TimeElapsed        time.Duration // Session duration
}

// Trigger thresholds
var CompactThresholds = ContextMetrics{
    TokenCount:         10000,
    ConversationLength: 50,
    CodeVolume:         500,
    TopicSwitches:      5,
    TimeElapsed:        2 * time.Hour,
}
```

#### Context Preservation Strategy
- **Essential Information**: Key decisions, architecture choices, performance metrics
- **Active Tasks**: Current work status, next steps, blockers
- **Configuration**: Project settings, build configurations, environment details
- **Progress Tracking**: Milestone completion, test results, quality metrics

### For Human Developers

#### Context Awareness
- Monitor conversation length and complexity
- Recognize when context becomes cluttered
- Proactively suggest context cleanup
- Maintain focus on current objectives

#### Session Management
- Set clear session boundaries
- Document important decisions before cleanup
- Plan context cleanup during natural breaks
- Coordinate context cleanup with team members
